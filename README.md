# Voice Controlled Car

Hello, this is my first IoT project on Github.<br>
It is basically a arduino based voice controlled car, which is controlled by the voice commands over bluetooth.<be>

Voice commands:<br>
  - Forward - Car will move forward
  - Backward - Car will move backwards
  - Left - Car will turns to left
  - Right - Car will turn to right
  - Dance - Car will show some specific moves.<be>
